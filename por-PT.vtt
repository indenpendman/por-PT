00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
Aren't you crazy?

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.080
Dare to cause trouble at the Su family's house?

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.400
Do you think my problems aren't enough for you?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.120
I gave up everything for you

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120
and you blame me?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.120
Brother

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.400
Sujinyue stole your money

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.400
You should demand it back from him

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.640
What are you afraid of?

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.320
Son

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.680
You don't still have feelings for

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.000
that Su Jinyue, do you?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Unreasonable

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.680
The invitation from the Su family

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.400
They want us to attend the banquet

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.800
What does the Su family mean?

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000
Do they know about Su Jinyue's shameful deeds

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.160
and want him to pay it back?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.360
The Su family has a project to give to our Zhao family

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.360
We saved them

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.360
Su Jinyue 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.480
What are you doing here?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.720
Today is the Su family's banquet

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.440
This is not a place for just anyone to come

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
You don't need to trouble Miss Lin

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.040
What

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.640
Did you spend all the compensation from your family in two months?

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.640
You

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.200
Don't think that you can be part of the Su family

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.120
just because you seduced them

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120
You dare talk to me like this?

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.440
Do you want to see me embarrassed?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.760
You're dreaming

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.240
An affair is worth less than a chicken

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.960
I want to see how long you can keep acting tough

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.040
Besides, you're not even a phoenix

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.920
Alright

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.480
I don't want to argue with you today

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.640
After all, it's the Su family's banquet

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.560
If you want to stay

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.000
then leave quickly

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.520
Don't make me call security to throw you out

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.280
Lin Xue

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.480
Do you really think this is your Lin family?
